    content: "Hey guys. I'm sure you're all asking where the updates are, and to be honest we haven't pushed any updates at all since the new launcher update, the team and I have lost motivation entirely. For the past two and a half years, Aero Client has been the best CheatBreaker reskin ever seen, we've stopped countless cheaters, we've achieved what most reskins could never do, make a launcher that works, we gave everyone cosmetics, and much more. These milestones have been amazing to achieve, but as many know, all good things must come to an end. Aero Client will not receive updates in the near future. Sorry guys. Thank you for supporting us. We might return, but that is unclear. AGAIN, Aero Client will still be kept up, but will not receive updates, cosmetics will still be kept as well if you have them.";
